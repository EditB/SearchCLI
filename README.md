# SearchCLI

A simple Node.js CLI app to search a field in a json file and display the results.
It will return JSON object(s) if there are matching values, otherwise it will return nothing.

Run it with this command: node search

It uses the following versions:

 node: v9.11.1
 npm: 6.4.1

 And dependencies:
 inquirer: 6.2.0

Note: tested it on Windows 10 Command Prompt; looks like jq has some windows cmd shell quoting issues.
